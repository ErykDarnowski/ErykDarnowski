# Preview

A nice way to preview the `README.md` while working is [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) + the [coc-markdown-preview-enchanced](https://github.com/weirongxu/coc-markdown-preview-enhanced) extension.
An alternative would be a CLI tool like [glow](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow) but the obvious disadvantage here is the discrepancies between the browser and terminal representations of markdown (especially with things like images / web elements)!
